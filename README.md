Dependencies
============

Action Bar Pull To Refresh
--------------------------
https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh

Add
```
<uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="X"
        android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
```
to the AndroidManifest.xml file (If doesn't already exist). Other than that, DefaultHeaderTransformer.java may give errors on line 375. If you encounter the errors change the line to 
```
.strokeWidth(strokeWidth)
```




Smooth Progress Bar 
-------------------
(A dependency of Pull to refresh. You need to add it to Action Bar Pull to Refresh and not to Books!)

If you are using eclipse you may have to move the source files from java folder to src folder.
